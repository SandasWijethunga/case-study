Impact of Demographic Factors on Young Adults' Music Listening Habits

This project is a comprehensive data science case study examining how demographic characteristics (age, gender, degree program) and genre preferences influence the daily music consumption of young adults. The study utilizes primary data collected via field surveys and rigorous statistical analysis performed in R.

📊 Project Highlights
* Primary Data Collection: Designed and distributed a structured questionnaire to a sample of 200+ students across various campus disciplines.
* Statistical Rigor: Applied advanced inferential statistics, including One-Way ANOVA, Independent Sample T-tests, and Kruskal-Wallis tests to validate hypotheses.
* Key Finding: Discovered that academic discipline (Degree Program) has a statistically significant impact on daily listening time ($p < 0.05$), while certain genre   preferences showed high correlation with gender.
